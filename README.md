xigglyxuffIRC
=============

Python script for HexChat which changes the user's nick to a random Xigglyxuff. Requires the HexChat Python plugin (check box during
installation).

To execute the script automatically when connecting to a network, select Hexchat > Network List > freenode > Edit...

In the "Connect commands" tab, press "Add" and enter "/load %PATH_TO_SCRIPT%/xigglyxuffIRC.py" then press enter. Next time you connect to that server, your nick will change to a random Xigglyxuff! :D

Additionally, you can set a custom HexChat command to execute the script manually by clicking Settings > User Commands.
